# perfect

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of perfect is to calculate and plot total perfectionism scores.

## Installation

perfect is not yet on CRAN, but can be downloaded using this command: 

``` r
devtools::install_github("stat545ubc-2021/AbigailYuenAssignmentB/AssignmentB2/perfect")
```

## Example

This is a basic example of how to use this package:

```{r example}
library(perfect)
total_perf(cps, C_SOP, C_SPP, C_OOP)
```

This package makes plotting the distribution of total perfectionism scores much more quick and efficient.
