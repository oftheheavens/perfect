# perfect

### What is this project?

This is a collection of files for my STAT545B project where I had to create a package and a function, which I named "perfect" and "total_perf" respectively. I made this primarily for my own use. 


### Files in project folder

**README.md** - A description of this project, the files within the project director, and how to use them. This file should contain all instructions future users may need to understand the work completed.

**perfect** - Inside this folder are all the files for the package, including the description, tests, and md files. 

### How to run code in folder

These files are intended to be accessed through R Studio. They were made using R Version 4.1.1.
