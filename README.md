# perfect


### What is this project?

This is a collection of files used for my STAT 545B assignment, where I have to create a new package and function which I named "perfect" and "total_perf", respectively.


### Files in project folder

**README.md** - A description of this project, the files within the project director, and how to use them. This file should contain all instructions future users may need to understand the work completed.

**perfect** - A folder containing all ym files for the project, including a DESCRIPTION, Rmd, tests, and included data. 

### How to run code in folder

These files are intended to be accessed through R Studio. They were made using R Version 4.1.1.
